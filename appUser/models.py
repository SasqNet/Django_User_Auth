# Here's a breakdown of each line:

# from django.db import models: This line is importing Django's built-in models module, which contains classes and functions for defining the data models in your application. However, in this specific code snippet, models is not being used.

# from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser: This line is importing the AbstractUser class from Django's built-in authentication module. AbstractUser is a base class for the user model that includes core implementation like fields and methods for handling users.

# class User(AbstractUser): pass: This line is defining a new class User that inherits from AbstractUser. The pass keyword is used because User doesn't add any new fields or methods to AbstractUser - it's just a direct subclass.

# By creating a custom user model like this, you have the flexibility to add additional fields or methods in the future if your application needs them. For example, you could add a field to store the user's date of birth, or a method to calculate the user's age.
